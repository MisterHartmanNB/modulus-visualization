# modulus-visualization

The idea here is to create a simple crossover between computer science and math, by visualizing the remainder
In the HTML, the site should take two inputs and display them with the modulus operator between them
In the p5.js javaScript canvas, the program should draw squares to visually demonstrate the modulus
The first number of squares should be arranged in rows that are the second number long
The remaining number on top should be the modulus.
Each row should be full width of the canvas except the modulus row drawn on top
Color coding should be used to represent each row and the modulus row
1 - Red
2 - Orange
3 - Yellow
4 - Green
5 - Blue
6 - Purple
7 - Light Purple
8 - Reddish Purple
9 - Gray
10 - White
If a row is longer than 10, each group of 10 should be represented by white blocks, then the remainder by the corresponding color
